Javascript Exercise:

This exercise can be done with React.js, JQuery or vanilla javascript. Create a html document doing the following.

1. Given the following list of countries (end of the document) create a grid showing the whole list of countries names and codes. Add a column with a checkbox to select/deselect rows.

2. Create a button on the top of the grid that when clicked, will show an alert with the comma separated codes of the countries selected with the checkboxes.

3. On the top of the list there will be a search input that will filter the list of countries looking to its name in a case insensitive manner.
Show only the found countries (the rest should be removed or hidden from the grid).
